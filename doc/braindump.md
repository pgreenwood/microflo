Thoughts on best practices
======================

Components must have a single, well defined, task.
The input and output data (interface) must be minimal.
It is 'preferable' that the component has minimal internal state, and low internal complexity.
Design the component for black-box testing.

A programmer may chose to make one "fat" component in C++, or compose the same ''logical''
function as a graph of many small/"thin" MicroFlo components. The latter may result in larger reusability.
But if the straightforward solution is a fat component, maybe make that first, then decompose as an (optional)
second step. Reasons for this can include reuse/retrofitting existing code, flow-based thinking not familiar
or not easily applicable to the problem domain.
Conversely, if and when a graph of thin components does not perform well enough, combining into a supercomponent may
be a viable strategy.

User Interface
==============

Foundations
------------
Microprocessor programs are embedded software; they make little sense without the
accompaning hardware and the real-life environment on which they act.

How to avoid "blindly manipulating symbols"? [ref](http://vimeo.com/66085662)
Need direct manipulation, interactive parametrization.

How to go from telling the machine HOW to do things, to defining WHAT it does?

Ideas
-------

Realist

* Show serial console(s), allow to send data to uController
* Allow to subscribe to data flowing through connections, inspect
* Allow to change the graph, upload new config at runtime and persist a new config to device
* Visualize the state of the uController in/out ports/peripherals
* Allow to add mock HW components and attach to uController

Idealist

* Monitor the graph, recording the events by default - then be able to
go back in time and replay the events - maybe export to regression test?
* Visualizations for data flowing through graph and components. Interactive, custom
* Dynamic changes to graph while running
* Data breakpoints/conditionals and expressions
* Allow to parameterize behaviour, explore classes of systems, relationships
* Allow defining components/graphs/programs by "macro recording" and defining input-output relationships
* Let HW components be properly simulated electronics, allow to output schematics/layouts


Hardware targets
===================
ARM Cortex-M3/M4(F) most interesting. Dirty-cheap modules available from TI (Launchpad) and STM (Discovery)

Correctness, Testing
=====================
Can one generate/create some general tests for a component by describing/classifying the component?

Possible Classes, Invariants.

* I/O: has real-world side-effect / external state
* Pure: not stateful, without side-effects
* Syncronous: Sends message out as direct result of message in
* Generator: Creates messages on its own (without requiring input)
* 1-1: One message out for every message out
* Deterministic: Same sequence of inputs results in same sequence of outputs
* State-free: Same input message always results in same output message
* Real-time/bounded-time: A message in is guaranteed to have its corresponding output within a certain time
* Cooperative: Yields the compute within a certain time

Are there formalisms which can be provably correct that are suited for components?

* Finite State Machine
* Truth tables
* Boolean algebra/logic
* Mathematical expression

Arduino, advancements and lacks
================================
Arduino is a massively succesfull project which has made it much easier
to program microcontrollers, both for hobbyists and professionals.

Advancements
* Microcontroller can be programmed without speciality HW programmer
* Development boards are cheap, and can be used directly in small-scale production
* User does not have to care about registers and interrupts
* Large open software ecosystem: libraries and example sketches
* Large open hardware ecosystems: boards,shields,peripherals
* Cross-platform, minimal IDE for starting out
* Easy to extend computer I/O and do programming there (Firmata)
* Breadboard diagrams for easy HW layout, compared to schematics+PCB (Fritzing)

Lacks
* User has to learn to read and write C/C++
* Few best practices for organizing and architecting non-trivial programs
* No device simulator or emulator widely available
* Very few practices around structured and automated testing
* Mostly focused on polling based syncronous code
* LGPL license, unclear if use in proprietary products OK
* No freely available IDE which does both hardware and software
* Purely textual programming, not making use of peoples visual capabilities


Free (as in freedom) electronics devices
=====================================================
The Free Software movement aims to provide end-users of software the freedom to
use, study, modify and redistribute the software. After 30 years, this is still
an exception, not the rule. Reasons are many, including some hard to change:
* Few incentives for manufacturers to provide such freedom
* Many users do not care for such freedom, most of the time

One failing which the movement itself have to take responsibility for,
is that the ways to discover, make use of, and benefit from these freedoms have placed
a high burden on the user.
* Programs are often shipped to the end-user without the required tools.
* These tools often require extensive training/experience to use.
* The archetypical programming model establishes next to no direct connections
between the behaviour of the system and the recipe (source code) which define it.
* Sharing modified programs has required lengthy registration/setup of online project sites,
and because programs are not easily tested on different targets, often incur a large support cost

Electronics devices, which traditionally were thought of as mostly hardware (electronics and mechanics),
are increasingly defined by their software components. This trend is likely to continue and accellerate.
This means that the software freedom also applies to such devices, from your TV to your oven and fridge.

Additional complications with HW include
- significant cost of reproduction (inherent)
- software on these devices has real-life effects: misconfigured SW may destroy hardware or surroundings

Complex hetrogenous systems and the Internet of Things
=============================================================================
There is a tendency for more and more interconnected systems, whos realization
spans multiple architectural levels and domains.
- Embedded devices. One or more microcontrollers, microprocessors.
Potentially also reconfigurable hardware; FPGA, analog blocks, external digital logic
- Host computers.
- Server clusters.
- The cloud. Distributed online services that collaborate.
- End-user clients. Mobile devices; tablet and phones. Workstations and laptops.

Each of these are traditionally tackled with separate tools, programming languages and mindsets.

Flow-based programming is language and detail-level agnostic concept, and may
be well suited for programming hetrogenous systems. Each level in the architecture
may be best targetted with a dedicated runtime optimizing for the specific concerns.
But the systems should be interoperable and the tools allow to navigate seamlessly between
flows on different levels and in different "domains". Merely being able to visualize and monitor
such complex systems as they run may prove of enormous value.

* NoFlo targets computers and clients.
* MicroFlo targets embedded devices.
* For clusters, perhaps something based on ZeroMQ?
* For the cloud, ???
